# Documentation Migration Summary

## Completed Tasks

The documentation migration has been successfully completed:

1. **THG Commerce Insights** documentation has been migrated to `src/content/docs/insights/` with the following structure:
   - Main index page
   - Getting started guide
   - Framework-specific guides (Astro, Next.js, React Native)
   - Core documentation (beacon)
   - Implementation guides (altitude, offline-support, source-resolution, troubleshooting)
   - API reference

2. **Horizon Public Docs** have been migrated to `src/content/docs/commerce-api/` with the following structure:
   - Main index page (with "Horizon" renamed to "Commerce API")
   - Examples organized by e-commerce functionality:
     - Basket
     - Checkout
     - Customer
     - Features
     - Navigation
     - Product

## Issues and Resolutions

- There were a few missing files in the source project:
  - The `product-lists` directory files were not found in the source project
  - The directory structure was created but the files could not be copied

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Test**:
   - Verify all internal links work correctly
   - Check that all images display properly
   - Ensure code examples are formatted correctly
   - Test navigation between sections

2. **Content Updates**:
   - Update any remaining references to "Horizon" that might have been missed
   - Fix any broken internal links (especially in the examples section)
   - Add content for the missing product-lists section

3. **Integration with Site Navigation**:
   - Update the site's navigation to include the new documentation sections
   - Ensure the sidebar navigation properly reflects the new structure

4. **Final Verification**:
   - Run the site locally to verify all pages render correctly
   - Check for any styling issues with the migrated content

## Commands to Test the Site

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/gourleyp/Sites/thg-commerce-docs

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

After starting the development server, you can access the site at http://localhost:4321 (or whichever port is configured) to verify the migrated documentation.
