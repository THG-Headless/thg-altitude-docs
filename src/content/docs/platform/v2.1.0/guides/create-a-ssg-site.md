title: Create an SSG Website
---

# Introduction

An SSG (Static Site Generator) site is a type of website that is generated from pre-built files rather than being dynamically generated by a server upon each request. On Altitude, you do not need to provide us with your built files, we can seamlessly manage your build step and provide you with a number of additional great factors.

- **Automatic Index Documents:** For SSG sites, if a request is made to a root folder (`/foo` for example), we will automatically check for the existence of an index document for that folder (`/foo/index.html` in this example) and serve this without any rewrite logic needed.
- **Custom Error Page:** You can show a custom 404 page when one of your customers requests an invalid path. For this to happen automatically, you can create a document under the path of `/404.html`. 

# Set-up

## 1. Edge Configuration

First set up your Altitude.yaml file to use `static` as a rendering type. This will let us know that your project has pre-built the HTML required to serve a page. An example config file is shown below:

**`altitude.yaml`**

```yaml
version: v2.1
provider: cloudflare
routes:
  - pathPrefix: /
    name: <your function/site name>
    type: static
    directory: .
    build:
      command: <your projects build command>
      output:
        directory: <your projects build directory (for e.g. dist)>
```

## 2. Build & Deploy.

Now you're ready to build and deploy.
