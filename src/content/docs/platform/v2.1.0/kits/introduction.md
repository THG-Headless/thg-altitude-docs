# Starter Kits

Altitude Platform provides a collection of pre-built starter kits that help you quickly launch new projects with best practices already implemented. These kits serve as a foundation for your applications, allowing you to focus on building your unique features rather than setting up infrastructure.

## What are Starter Kits?

Starter Kits are pre-configured project templates that include:

- Project structure and organization
- Build configurations
- Deployment settings
- Common functionality
- Integration with Altitude Platform

They are designed to accelerate your development process by providing a solid foundation that follows best practices for performance, security, and maintainability.

## Available Starter Kits

Altitude Platform offers several starter kits for different types of projects:

### Static Site Generator (SSG)

Perfect for content-focused websites that don't require dynamic server functionality. These sites are pre-built at deploy time and served as static files, offering excellent performance and security.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Ideal for dynamic websites that need to generate HTML on the server for each request. These kits provide the infrastructure for running server code at the edge, close to your users.

### Single Page Application (SPA)

Great for highly interactive applications where most of the rendering happens in the browser. These kits provide the setup for client-side JavaScript applications.

## Benefits of Using Starter Kits

- **Faster Development**: Start with a working foundation rather than from scratch
- **Best Practices**: Built-in patterns for performance, security, and maintainability
- **Seamless Deployment**: Pre-configured for deployment to Altitude Platform
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach across multiple projects
- **Focus on Features**: Spend time building what makes your project unique

## Getting Started

To get started with a Starter Kit, follow the [Create a Website](../guides/create-a-site) guide and select one of the available templates during the site creation process.

For more advanced users who want to create their own starter kits, we'll be adding detailed documentation on how to create and publish custom starter kits to the Altitude Platform.
