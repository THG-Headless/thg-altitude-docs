# Carousel

## Overview

The carousel is used to display a set of images or content in an organised and easily navigable manner.

These carousels have can be scrolled by holding `SHIFT` and scrolling the mouse wheel, vertically scrolling with a track pad, setting the focus on the carousel by clicking it or navigating to it using keyboard navigation and using the arrow keys to navigate through the carousel.

For the best user experience, and best accessibility it is recommended to implement buttons to control the carousel. For these purposes, [Control Buttons](/components/button) or [Pips](/components/pips)

## Example Usage

### Basic Carousel

The basic html structure of the carousel is seen below, applying the base styles without providing any more complex behaviour such as scroll snapping.

<ComponentPreview>
  <BasicCarousel />
</ComponentPreview>

### Tight Carousel

Applying the `carousel-tight` class will remove the gap between the items.

<ComponentPreview>
  <Tight />
</ComponentPreview>

### Snapping Styles

A number of snapping styles have been provided, giving you the option for how you would like the carousel to behave. It is recommended to choose one of these, as it will improve the keyboard navigation within your carousel as users can quickly navigate through the items.

#### Start Snap

The `carousel-snap-start` class will snap the items to the left edge of the carousel.

<ComponentPreview>
  <SnapStart />
</ComponentPreview>

#### End Snap

The `carousel-snap-end` class will snap the items to the right edge of the carousel.

<ComponentPreview>
  <SnapEnd />
</ComponentPreview>

#### Center Snap

The `carousel-snap-center` class will snap the items to the middle of the carousel.

<ComponentPreview>
  <SnapCenter />
</ComponentPreview>

#### Snap Alignment

By adding the `carousel-align` class, additional padding is added to the carousel such that all items will follow the snapping style.

<ComponentPreview>
  <SnapPad />
</ComponentPreview>

### Carousel Content

Content can be added as well as images, and should be placed within a div with the class `carousel-content` applied.

<ComponentPreview>
  <CarouselContent />
</ComponentPreview>

If the content of the carousels includes elements that are interactive such as buttons, then this will mean that a keyboard user will have to navigate through all of the items in the carousel to get to the next section of the site.

Tab index of -1 are provided for the items, and a tab index of -2 should be applied to all interactive elements within them.

Javascript will be required in order to manage focus. This should implement the following behaviour:

- Users can navigate to the carousel wrapper
- Pressing ENTER on the carousel wrapper should trap focus into the carousel
- Tab and Shift Tab should navigate through the items
- The escape key should bring focus out of the items, and back to the carousel wrapper

If the user is on a item within the carousel, they should be able to:

- A user can press enter to trap their focus on the item
- The user should be able to navigate through any interactive elements for the item
- Pressing the escape key should bring their focus out of the item, and back to the carousel

<ComponentPreview>
  <CarouselInteractive />
</ComponentPreview>

### Banner Carousel

By adding the `carousel-banner` class, the items will become full width, with the content and image placed next to each other.

<ComponentPreview>
  <CarouselBanner />
</ComponentPreview>

If a carousel item contains only one child, it will be full width regardless of the banner image width variable.

<ComponentPreview>
  <CarouselBannerImageOnly />
</ComponentPreview>
