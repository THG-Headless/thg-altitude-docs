# Shadows

Like with the radius, the use of a singular site shadow is promoted in order to maintain consistency and allow for easy updates of your theme. As with the radius, this can be overridden at a per use case level, but it is advised to use the site shadow provided.

The site shadow is defined using the CSS variable `--shadow-site`

<ShadowDisplay />
