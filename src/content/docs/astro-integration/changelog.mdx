# Altitude Platform Changelog

This page contains a summary of the changelog for astro integration. A full changelog can be viewed [here](https://github.com/THG-AltitudeSiteBuilds/astro-integration/releases/)

## v2.0.0

### Changed
- Simplified requirements for single tenancy mode - i18n key no longer required. 
- Rewrites only occur for i18n-enabled tenants, as opposed to all of them.
- `domains` required property in buildConfig is now an array
- `locales<Object>.domain` is now a required property
- Top-level 'KV' key is now optional

### Fixed
- Fixed single tenancy mode

### Deprecated

- removed support for cookie routing
- `locals.altitude.preferredLocale`, `locals.altitude.localeDomains` are now deprecated
- We are no longer exposing `locals.altitude.localeCookie`
- Several keys previously available on the global context in v1.x (such as `localeCookie`) are no longer exposed in v2. If you are migrating, review your usage of global context keys and update your code accordingly.
