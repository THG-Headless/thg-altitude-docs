## Features

### Automatic View Tracking

Built-in support for tracking page and screen views across all platforms:

```typescript
// Web Example (Astro or Next.js)
import insights from '@thg-commerce/insights/astro'; // or /next

// Initialize with framework-specific integration
insights({
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com/events',
  debug: true
});
```

### Framework Support

Works seamlessly with multiple frameworks:

<Table
  headers={["Framework", "Integration Type", "Auto-tracking"]}
  rows={[
    ["Astro", "Integration", "✅"],
    ["Next.js", "Middleware/Hook", "✅"],
    ["React Native", "SDK", "✅"]
  ]}
/>

### Offline Support

Never lose an event with automatic queueing and retries:

```typescript
// Events are automatically queued when offline
const tracker = createTracker({
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com/events',
  domain: 'my-app',
  debug: true
});

// Queued events are sent when connectivity is restored
```

<Note title="Offline Handling">

    },

      emoji: "2️⃣",
      title: "Persist",
      description: "Persisted across app restarts"
    },
    {
      emoji: "3️⃣",
      title: "Send",
      description: "Sent in order when connectivity returns"
    },
    {
      emoji: "4️⃣",
      title: "Deduplicate",
      description: "Deduplicated to prevent double-counting"
    }
  ]} />
</Note>

### Lightweight Implementation

Minimal impact on application performance:

<BulletList items={[
  "Smart batching of events",
  "Automatic sampling for high-traffic sites",
  "Tiny bundle size (<5KB gzipped)",
  "No external dependencies"
]} />

### Configurable Options

Customize tracking behavior with flexible options:

```typescript
insights({
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com/events',
  debug: true,
  sampling: {
    enabled: true,
    rate: 0.1 // Sample 10% of events
  },
  batch: {
    size: 50,
    interval: 5000 // Send every 5 seconds
  }
});
```

### TypeScript Support

Full type definitions for enhanced development experience:

```typescript
interface InsightsConfig {
  endpoint: string;
  debug?: boolean;
  sampling?: {
    enabled: boolean;
    rate: number;
  };
  batch?: {
    size: number;
    interval: number;
  };
}
```

<Warning title="Production Usage">
<BulletList items={[
  "Set appropriate sampling rates for high-traffic sites",
  "Configure batch settings based on your needs",
  "Disable debug mode in production"
]} />
