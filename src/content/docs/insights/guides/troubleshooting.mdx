# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues you might encounter when using Ingenuity Insights and their solutions.

## Network Issues

### Events Not Being Sent

**Symptoms:**
- Events appear in debug logs but aren't reaching your endpoint
- Queue length keeps growing

**Solutions:**
1. Check your endpoint URL is correct and accessible
2. Verify your network connection
3. Check browser console for CORS errors
4. Ensure your endpoint accepts POST requests

### Offline Handling

**Symptoms:**
- Events are queued but not sent when online
- "Device is offline" messages in debug logs

**Solutions:**
1. Events are automatically queued when offline
2. They will be sent when connection is restored
3. Check `getQueueLength()` to monitor the queue
4. Ensure your endpoint can handle batch processing

## Configuration Issues

### Source Resolution

**Symptoms:**
- Events have incorrect or missing source
- "localhost" appearing as source

**Solutions:**
1. Check your source configuration:
```typescript
// Static source
const beacon = new Beacon({
  endpoint: '...',
  source: 'my-app'
});

// Dynamic source
const beacon = new Beacon({
  endpoint: '...',
  sourceResolver: new WebDomainResolver()
});
```

2. For React Native, ensure you're providing an app identifier:
```typescript
const beacon = new Beacon({
  endpoint: '...',
  source: 'com.myapp'
});
```

### Sampling Rate

**Symptoms:**
- Not all events are being tracked
- "Event skipped due to sampling" in debug logs

**Solutions:**
1. Check your sampling rate configuration:
```typescript
const beacon = new Beacon({
  endpoint: '...',
  source: 'my-app',
  sampleRate: 0.1 // Only track 10% of events
});
```

2. Set `sampleRate` to 1 to track all events:
```typescript
const beacon = new Beacon({
  endpoint: '...',
  source: 'my-app',
  sampleRate: 1 // Track 100% of events
});
```

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to get detailed logs about event tracking:

```typescript
const beacon = new Beacon({
  endpoint: '...',
  source: 'my-app',
  debug: true
});
```

Debug logs will show:
- Event queueing
- Sampling decisions
- Network status
- Send attempts
- Error details

## Common Error Messages

### "Failed to send event, will retry later"

**Cause:** Network request to endpoint failed
**Solution:** Check endpoint availability and network connection

### "Device is offline, keeping events in queue"

**Cause:** No network connection detected
**Solution:** Events will be sent automatically when connection is restored

### "Event skipped due to sampling"

**Cause:** Event was not selected for tracking due to sampling rate
**Solution:** Increase or remove sampling rate if you need more events

## Still Need Help?

If you're encountering issues not covered here:

1. Enable debug mode to get more information
2. Check your browser's developer tools console
3. Verify your endpoint is receiving and processing requests correctly
4. Review your configuration against the documentation
