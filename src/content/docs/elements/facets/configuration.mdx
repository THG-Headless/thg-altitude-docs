# Props

## FacetWrapper Props

The `FacetWrapper` component requires one instance per page. Its props configure the API endpoint, URL parameters, and shared information such as currency symbols.

#### filterName

- • **Type:** `String`
- • **Required:** Yes
- The URL parameter name used for facets (e.g. `facetFilters`).

### Options Object

The `options` prop contains settings for API requests:

#### endpoint

- • **Type:** `String`
- • **Required:** Yes
- Path to your GraphQL endpoint - this **must** be a relative path (e.g. `/api/commerce`).

#### pageType

- • **Type:** `'search' | 'collection'`
- • **Required:** Yes
- Determines the schema to be used.

#### query

- • **Type:** `String`
- • **Required:** Yes
- Search query or collection path handle.

#### shippingDestination

- • **Type:** `String`
- • **Required:** Yes
- Shipping destination code for Horizon requests.

#### currency

- • **Type:** `String`
- • **Required:** Yes
- Currency code for Horizon requests.

#### currencySymbol

- • **Type:** `String`
- • **Required:** No
- The currency symbol to be appended to pricing labels

### Example Configuration

```javascript
<FacetWrapper
  filterName="facetFilters"
  options={{
    endpoint: "/api/graphql",
    pageType: "search",
    query: searchTerm,
    shippingDestination: "GB",
    currency: "GBP",
  }}
  currencySymbol="£"
>
  {/* Slot content */}
</FacetWrapper>
```

## FacetResults Props

Multiple `FacetResults` components can be used within one `FacetWrapper`. This is useful for different UIs between desktop and mobile viewports.

#### id

- • **Type:** `String`
- • **Required:** Yes
- Unique identifier for each instance of the FacetResults component.

#### facetPayload

- • **Type:** `Array`
- • **Required:** Yes
- Pre-hydration data for facet headers to aid in rendering an initial loading states. Must be processed using `validateFacets` helper to remove unnecessary facet headings.

#### singleActiveFacet

- • **Type:** `Boolean`
- • **Required:** No
- • **Default:** `true`
- Controls whether multiple facets can be "active" at a time. If the desired behaviour is to enable multiple facets to be active at a time `false` should be provided. This prop also controls click away behaviour which is enabled when this prop is set to `true`.

#### hydrateOptions

- • **Type:** `visible` | `all`
- • **Required:** No
- • **Default:** `visible`
- Controls the hydration behaviour upon initial render. By default options will only be hydrated when the `options` receiver is toggled i.e top level facet group is clicked. If options are to be hydrated immediately, set this props value to `all`

#### facetRenderCount

- • **Type:** `*` | `Number`
- • **Required:** No
- • **Default:** `*`
- Determines how many options to hydrate. By default all options will be hydrated in else a number can be supplied to cap the number that are hydrated. Helper functions can be used in conjuction with custom UI to implement a "Show More" toggle.

#### visibleOptions

- • **Type:** `*` | `Number`
- • **Required:** No
- • **Default:** `*`
- Determines the number of top level facets that are shown. By default all top level facets are shown. When a number is passed, if the number of facet headings exceeds this number, additional UI will be hydrated on to the page enabling toggle behaviour.

#### keepSelectedGroupActive

- • **Type:** `Boolean`
- • **Required:** No
- • **Default:** `false`
- Attempts to keep the facet group where a selection was made active. By default this behaviour is turned off due to inconsistency in facet heading ordering. This prop should only be set to true when your UI does not display other facet headings when the facet is active i.e A mobile drilldown menu. The facet type `SliderFacet` will not stay active to provide visual feedback to users.

#### text

A text object can be passed to add copy to parts of the default UI. The only copy required for this default UI is the `toggle` key.

#### aria

An object can be passed to provide aria labels to elements. The following keys can be used to assign a label to this components default UI.

More details on how to configure accessibility labels can be viewed [here](/facets/accessibility)

- `moreFiltersToggle` - Label applied to the toggle button when not expanded i.e. "Show more filters"
- `lessFiltersToggle` - Label applied to the toggle button when expanded i.e. "Show less filters"
- `toggleFacetButton` - Label applied to the top level facet element which triggers visibility of options.

### Example Configuration

```javascript
<FacetResults
  id="desktop"
  facetPayload={validFacets}
  singleActiveFacet={false}
  hydrateOptions="visible"
  facetRenderCount={4}
  visibleOptions="*"
  keepSelectedGroupActive={false}
  text={{ toggle: "+ More Filters" }}
  aria={{
    moreFiltersToggle: "Show more filters",
    lessFiltersToggle: "Show less filters",
    toggleFacetButton:
      "Expand {facet-group-name-display}, {facet-selected-count} option(s) currently selected",
  }}
>
  {/* Slot content */}
</FacetResults>
```

## FacetList Props

The FacetList provides an out the box UI for facets with the following typename: `SimpleFacet`. This should be nested within the `FacetResults` component.

This should consume the named slot `facet-list`

#### open

- • **Type:** `Boolean`
- • **Required:** No
- • **Default:** `false`
- Sets the options to be active when first hydrated. If `true` is set, it is advised to set the `hydrateOptions="all"` prop in `FacetResults` to ensure the template is updated. Named [slots](/facets/slots) can be used to configure loading states to minimise CLS.

#### text

A text object can be passed to add copy to parts of the default UI. The only copy required for this default UI is the `clear` key.

#### aria

  }}
>
  {/* slot content */}
</FacetRange>
```

## FacetSearch Props

  aria={{
    clearOptions: "Clear selected option {facet-option-name-display}",
    clearAll: "Clear all selected options",
  }}
/>
```

## Client Script

The elements package will initialise facets on the users behalf hydrating facets in as per the `hydrateOptions` value on each facet instance.

### Initialisation

An application will be responsible for defining the `elements-facet-wrapper` custom HTML Element on the page.

```javascript
class ElementsFacetWrapper extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    // Additional setup
  }
}

customElements.get("elements-facet-wrapper") ||
  customElements.define("elements-facet-wrapper", ElementsFacetWrapper);
```

### Observer

When notable events occur, the elements package will publish these events on different channels. This enables an application to subscribe to these channels and run any neccessary updates i.e refreshing a product list.

The PubSub instance is contained with the facets class on the window object (`window.elements.facets`). The elements package will initialise this class upon setup and emit a custom event which will enable applications to access this class an the observer, as well as [helper functions](/facets/functions).

There are three channels intended for applications to subscribe to:

- `facet-toggle` This is published to when more/less facet groups are shown.
- `facet-hydrated` This is published to when a facet group has it's options hydrated in.
- `refresh-product-list` This is published to when facet data has been refetched, signalling an application should also refresh it's product list in line with the new selected facet options.

```javascript
connectedCallback() {
  window.addEventListener(
      'elements-facet-wrapper',
      () => {
        const { observer } = window.elements.facets
        observer.subscribe('facet-toggle', (data) => {...} )
      }
  );
}
```
