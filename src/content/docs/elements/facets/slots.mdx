## Overview

The Elements package leverages slots to allow customisation on top of, or to replace the default UI.

## FacetResults

The `FacetResults` component is the most outer layer of the Facets UI you can modify. There are two options in order to modify the UI:

1. Consume the slot `elements-facets-results-container` to create a completely bespoke UI.
2. Consumed additional named slots to modify aspects of the UI.

Each slot has a unique name which can be consumed by additional out-the-box components exported by the Elements package, or through custom markup:

- `<slot name="facet-tabs-start" />` UI for currently selected Facets, placed **before** facets in the DOM tree - An out-the-box UI component for this slot is exported as `FacetTabs`
- `<slot name="facet-tabs-end" />` UI for currently selected Facets, placed **after** facets in the DOM - An out-the-box UI component for this slot is exported as `FacetTabs`
- `<slot name="elements-facets-sort-start" />` UI for sort options **within** parent node of any facets
- `<slot name="facet-button" />` UI for any additional content on the top level facet button i.e Selected counters
- `<slot name="facet-list" />` UI for the facet group `SimpleFacet` - An out-the-box UI component for this slot is exported as `FacetList`
- `<slot name="facet-range" />` UI for the facet group `RangedFacet` - An out-the-box UI component for this slot is exported as `FacetRange`
- `<slot name="facet-slider" />` UI for the facet group `FacetSlider` - An out-the-box UI component for this slot is exported as `FacetSlider`
- `<slot name="facet-search" />` UI for the facets where the facetName contains `_brand_` - An out-the-box UI component for this slot is exported as `FacetSearch`

## UI Component slots

When using the out-the-box UI components for the facet groups, additional named slots can be consumed to change or extend the display of these components. Adding additional markup **without** consuming a named slot will result in a completely custom UI.

Below is a list of the named slots and the component these named slots are present in:

- `<slot name="elements-facet-options-header" />` Additional UI can be added above the facet options. <br /> _Components: **All**_
- `<slot name="elements-facets-option-list" />` The UI for the facet options can be overriden by consuming this slot. <br /> _Components: **FacetList**, **FacetRange**, **FacetSearch**_
- `<slot name="elements-facets-slider" />` The UI for the slider can be overriden by consuming this slot. <br /> _Components: **FacetSlider**_
- `<slot name="elements-facet-options-footer" />` Additional UI can be added below the facet options. <br /> _Components: **All**_
- `<slot name="elements-facet-list-search" />` The UI for the search input can be overriden by consuming this slot. <br /> _Components: **FacetSearch**_

```astro
<FacetList>
    <p slot="elements-facet-options-header">This is custom markup</p>
</FacetList>
```

## Custom UI

When creating a UI using custom markup, it is worth noting that the markup provided to the elements package is intended to be used as a template. Data [attributes](/facets/attributes) are used to inject and populate dynamic data to these templates.

This means that the UI defined for a facet group will be the same UI for all instances of that same facet group. Before defining a custom UI or consuming named slots, it is recommended to consult the documentation on how attributes are used.
