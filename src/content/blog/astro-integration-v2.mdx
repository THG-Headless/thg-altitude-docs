We're excited to announce the release of **Astro Integration v2.0**‚Äîa major update that simplifies configuration, improves single tenancy support, and streamlines the developer experience. This release includes several breaking changes, so read on to understand what's new and how to upgrade.

## What's New in v2.0

### Simplified Configuration API

The biggest change in v2.0 is how you configure the integration. We've moved from a direct parameter approach to a more flexible options object:

**Before (v1):**

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import tenants from "./config";
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    altitudeMiddleware(tenants, { enabled: true, graphql: gqlIndex }), // ‚ùå Direct parameters
  ],
  output: "server",
  // remaining config
});
```

**After (v2):**

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import tenants from "./config";
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    altitudeMiddleware({
      // ‚úÖ Options object
      config: tenants, // ‚úÖ Config property
      api: { enabled: true, graphql: gqlIndex },
    }),
  ],
  output: "server",
  // ... remaining config
});
```

This new approach makes the API more flexible and future-proof.

### Streamlined Domain Configuration

We've simplified how domains are configured across your tenant configs. The old nested object structure was unnecessarily complex and confusing‚Äîv2.0 replaces it with a simple, intuitive array:

**Before (v1):**

```js
// config/powerman.js
domains: {
  default: "www.example.com",        // ‚ùå Unnecessary nesting
  variants: ["www.example.com", "www.example.fr"]  // ‚ùå Confusing structure
}
// ... remaining keys remain the same
```

**After (v2):**

```js
// config/powerman.js
domains: ["www.example.com", "www.example.fr"]; // ‚úÖ Simple, clear array
// ... remaining keys remain the same
```

This change eliminates the confusing distinction between `default` and `variants`, reduces complexity, and makes tenant configuration much more intuitive. When migrating, just make sure that the value for `domains.default` is the first item in the new `domains` array.

### Improved Single Tenancy Mode

Single tenancy mode has received significant improvements in v2.0:

- **Simplified setup**: The i18n key is no longer required for basic single tenancy configurations
- **Better performance**: Rewrites now only occur for i18n-enabled tenants
- **Fixed bugs**: Several issues with single tenancy mode have been resolved

### Optional KV Configuration

The top-level KV key is now optional, giving you more flexibility in how you structure your configuration files.

## Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: v2.0 includes several breaking changes that require code updates:

### 1. Configuration Structure

All configurations must now be passed as an options object (see examples above).

### 2. Domain References

If you reference `domains.variants` in your middleware or other code, update it to `domains`.

For example

```js
// Update this:
locals?.altitude?.runtime?.config?.domains?.variants.includes(...)

// To this:
locals?.altitude?.runtime?.config?.domains?.includes(...)
```

### 3. Removed Features

- **Cookie routing** has been removed. This feature was deprecated because it was only used by the [account](https://github.com/THG-Headless/account) repository, which has since migrated to resolving locales directly from the `x-altitude-instance` header.
- Several global context keys like `preferredLocale`, amd `localeCookie` are no longer bound to `context.altitude`.

### 4. i18n Requirements

- `locales<Object>.domain` is now a required property when using i18n. In v1.x, locales could be determined from cookies or URL paths. v2.0 now requires that each localized site has an associated global top-level domain (gTLD). This is now enforced by through schema validation, so you will get a build-time error if this key is missing.
