## Introducing the Commerce Starter Kit

Today, we are excited to announce the addition of the Commerce Starter Kit to our <a href="/kits" target="_blank">Starter Kit Directory</a>. It is an Astro + React template for a commerce storefront, built on top of the Commerce API. The core functionality includes:

- List Pages
- Product Pages
- Search
- Basket
- Session Management

The kit is pre-optimised for performance, accessibility and SEO, and as with all Starter Kits, it is designed to be customised and extended as required.

## Commerce Ecosystem

The Commerce Starter Kit takes advantage of the <a href='/products/astro-integration' target='_blank'>Astro Integration</a> and <a href='/products/elements' target='_blank'>Elements</a> packages, exposing simplified APIs for functionality such as internationalisation and abstracting away complex business logic for Facets and Variations components. Also benefit from future updates via package version bumps.

The kit also integrates with Altitude's Account for managed login and register functionality.

## Multi-Tenancy

The Commerce Starter Kit uses <a href="/docs/platform/v2.3.0/edge/kv-store" target="_blank">Altitude KV Stores</a> to provide an extensible multi-tenancy pattern. This enables the hosting of storefronts for multiple uniquely-styled brands from a single Altitude site. The advantage of a KV-driven architecture is that it enables tenant config updates without requiring a site redeployment.

## What's next?

We're extending the base feature set as part of our Beta release. Upcoming features include:

- Quick Buy
- Subscriptions
- Product Recommendations
- Product Reviews
- Gifts With Purchase
