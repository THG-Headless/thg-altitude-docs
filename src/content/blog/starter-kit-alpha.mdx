## Introducing the Commerce Starter Kit

Today, we are excited to announce the addition of the Commerce Starter Kit to our <a href="/kits" target="_blank">Starter Kit Directory</a>.

Built on top of THG Commerce, the Commerce Starter Kit accelerates building commerce storefronts on Altitude. It provides core functionality out of the box, including:

- List Pages
- Product Pages
- Search
- Basket

And it's not just features - the kit is optimised for performance, accessibility and SEO. Neat!

The kit also integrates with with Altitude's Account to take advantage of managed features such as Login, Register and Order History.

## Commerce, Your Way

Customisability is at the heart of the starter kit philosophy. We've done the heavy lifting to provide core functionality, allowing you to focus on building a unique shopping experience for customers.

Want to tweak the product cards? No problem. Fancy adding a store locator? Go ahead. The kit becomes yours - designed to be customised and extended to meet your needs.

## Multi-Tenancy

The Commerce Starter Kit harnesses the power of <a href="/docs/platform/v2.3.0/edge/kv-store" target="_blank">Altitude KV Stores</a> to provide an extensible multi-tenancy pattern. Host storefronts for multiple brands, each with their own unique look and feel, from a single Altitude site.

And the best part? Update tenant config without a site redeployment.

## More features? Yes please.

We wanted to give you early access to see what the kit has to offer. But watch this space - we have further updates planned for Beta version, including:

- Quick Buy
- Subscriptions
- Product Recommendations
- Product Reviews
- Gifts With Purchase
