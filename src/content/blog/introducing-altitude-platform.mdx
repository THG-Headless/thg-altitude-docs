# Introducing THG Altitude: A New Developer Platform for the Edge

Today, we're thrilled to announce the launch of **THG Altitude**, a Developer Platform designed to streamline the deployment process for modern web applications. With Altitude, engineers can connect their Github project and deploy to a V8 edge environment in minutes, regardless of the worker-based framework they're using.

## Why We Built Altitude

The web development landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, with a growing emphasis on edge computing, serverless architectures, and improved developer experiences. However, we noticed a gap in the market for a platform that combines the power of edge computing with the flexibility to work with any worker-based framework.

Our goal with Altitude is to provide developers with a platform that:

1. **Simplifies deployment** - Connect your Github repository and deploy with minimal configuration
2. **Embraces the edge** - Leverage V8 isolates for fast, secure, and scalable applications
3. **Supports any worker-based framework** - Use the tools and frameworks you're already familiar with
4. **Provides a comprehensive ecosystem** - Access a suite of tools and components to accelerate development

## Key Features

Altitude offers a range of features and products to help developers build and deploy modern web applications:

### Platform Features

- **Github Integration** - Connect your repository and deploy on every push
- **Environment Management** - Manage multiple environments with different configurations
- **Domain Management** - Configure custom domains with automatic SSL
