# HTTP/3 Functionality Enabled

We are happy to announce that Altitude now supports HTTP/3 for sites deployed on our platform. Using HTTP/3, our sites will benefit from faster load times and improved security.

## What is HTTP/3?

HTTP/3 is the latest version of the HyperText Transfer Protocol. Unlike HTTP/2, HTTP/3 uses QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) to improve performance over TCP.

## Benefits of HTTP/3

- **Simplified Handshake**: The use of QUIC means TLS is combined into a single handshake, removing the need for multiple round trips required for TCP in HTTP/2 when establishing a connection.

- **Zero Round Trip Time**: When resuming a connection, HTTP/3 has 0-RTT (Zero Round Trip Time), meaning that clients can immediately start sending data without the full handshake. This will be particularly helpful for repeat visits to a site.

- **No Head-of-Line Blocking**: HTTP/3 supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests or responses to be sent simultaneously over a single connection. Unlike HTTP/2, where a lost packet could block all streams, HTTP/3 treats streams independently. This means only the affected stream is delayed, ensuring smoother and more reliable performance, even on networks with high packet loss.

- **Improved Connection Migration**: When a mobile user switches networks, e.g., moving from Wi-Fi to a mobile/cellular connection, HTTP/3 will allow users to switch without any disruption to their browsing.

- **Improved Security**: TLS is integrated into HTTP/3, meaning that encrypted connections are the default behavior.

## Why This Matters

By enabling HTTP/3, sites on Altitude will now be faster and more reliable, leading to a better user experience for sites on the Altitude platform.
