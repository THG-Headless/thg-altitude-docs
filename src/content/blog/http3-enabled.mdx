We are thrilled to announce that Altitude now supports HTTP/3 for sites deployed on our platform. This marks a significant step forward in delivering faster, more secure, and reliable web experiences for our users.

## What is HTTP/3?

HTTP/3 is the latest version of the HyperText Transfer Protocol, designed to address the limitations of previous versions. Unlike HTTP/2, HTTP/3 uses QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), a modern transport protocol that improves performance over traditional TCP.

## Benefits of HTTP/3

- **Simplified Handshake**: QUIC combines TLS into a single handshake, reducing the time required to establish a secure connection compared to HTTP/2.

- **Zero Round Trip Time (0-RTT)**: HTTP/3 allows clients to resume connections instantly, enabling faster data transmission for repeat visits.

- **No Head-of-Line Blocking**: Multiplexing in HTTP/3 ensures that a lost packet only delays the affected stream, unlike HTTP/2, where all streams could be blocked, results in smoother user expereince.

- **Improved Connection Migration**: HTTP/3 supports seamless connection migration, allowing users to switch networks (e.g., from Wi-Fi to mobile data) without disrupting their browsing experience.

- **Enhanced Security**: With TLS integrated into HTTP/3, encrypted connections are the default, ensuring robust security for all communications.

## Why This Matters

By enabling HTTP/3, sites on Altitude will now be faster and more reliable, leading to a better user experience for sites on the Altitude platform.

## How To Use

If your website is already hosted on the Altitude platform, you're already benefiting from HTTP/3â€”no additional work is required from developers or site owners.
