## What is Caching

Caching is a technique where we store frequently used data in temporary storage- a cache. This prevents the need to fetch data from the original source and reduces server load.

Suppose a user visits the home page of a website. This page may contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many images. Without caching, content would need to be fetched each time a user lands on the page, which would be costly. By caching the assets for the page, users get to the site very quickly and server load is reduced.

Imagine a developer makes a change to the website, e.g., putting an item on sale that will be highlighted on the home page. Since the content is cached, users would still be served the old version of the site without the sale. This could result in customers missing a sale and reduced revenue for the company. Thus, we need a way of clearing the cache when changes are made or content is out of date. This is called cache purging.

## Cache Purging on Altitude Platform

On Altitude Platform, we have six types of cache purging:

- **Path Purging**: Purge specific paths, such as '/products/books/', with the option to purge the cache of all paths that contain "/products/books/" as a prefix. You can also specify a specific domain as part of the path too, with a default of targeting all domains with that path.
- **Domain Purging**: Purge all content cached for a specific domain.
- **Global Purging**: This clears all cached content for an environment.
- **Key Purging**: This is a very targeted type of cache purging where specific content is targeted using the surrogate keys of specific content.
- **Redirects Purging**: Clear content for redirects for all redirects or specific rule groups.
- **Experimentation Purging**: Purge the cache associated with an experiment.

Having six options gives users a good amount of flexibility when targeting cached content they want to purge, minimizing unnecessary purges which reduces stress on infrastructure.

## Ways to use Altitude Cache Purging

We have two ways of engaging with the cache purging feature. Users can use the Altitude Platform API Cache Purge endpoint - see example below. This allows users to integrate cache purging into their CI/CD pipeline, removing the need for manual management of the cache.

#### Example: Purging the path /bar/ on domain www.foo.com with prefix purging enabled:

```
curl -i --location 'https://api.platform.thgaltitude.com/v1/sites/:siteId/purge-cache/:envName' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header "Authorization: Bearer $token" --data '{ "purgeType": "path", "domainName": "www.foo.com", "path": "/bar/", "prefix": true}'
```

Users can also use the Altitude Platform UI, which provides a user-friendly way to do path, domain, global, and key purging.

For more detail on how to use cache purging for your site deployed on Altitude Platform see the Altitude Platform [cache purging docs](https://thgaltitude.com/docs/platform/v2.3.0/edge/cache).

## Use Cases

### Landing Page Not Up to Date for a Sale

For the scenario in the introduction, a developer would want to use path purging on the homepage (and potentially other pages associated with the sale) to clear the cache so that users can see the sale when they reach the site.

### Content Management System (CMS) Integration

If you use a CMS that is in charge of publishing content for blogs on a site, the CMS could be configured to purge the cache whenever a new blog is published. The CMS could use the path purging option or, if there are surrogate keys associated with the blog content, use the key purging option to clear the cache.

### Change in a Site's Redirect Rules

If you make a change to a redirect rule and want to ensure that all users are redirected to the correct page, you could purge the cache for a specific rule group.

### Experimentation Coming to an End

Suppose your website has finished A/B testing. You would want users to no longer see the experimental versions of the site. In this case, the developer would use the experimentation cache purge type to remove the experimentation content, ensuring that all users now see the same version of the site when the experiment is finished.
